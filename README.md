# Photo Library App
This application allows users to upload pictures to their own photo library, where they can create different albums, add tags and a caption to their photos, copy/move photos between albums, search photos by date and/or tags, and more. This project is written in Java and JavaFX, and helped me learn about UI/UX design.
